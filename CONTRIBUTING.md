## Contributing

There are many ways you can contribute to the development of the **Butter Cake** framework:

- If you encounter any **bugs**, please open an [issue] (https://github.com/HimasRafeek/butterCake/issues/new). Try to include as much information possible, including but not limited to **detailed explanation, screenshots, operating system, browser and device**.

- **Feature requests** are a bit more complicated to process, as we need to get some community feedback on what is worth adding to the framework, but feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/HimasRafeek/ButterCake/issues/new) and we'll have a nice discussion.

- **Flavor files** are always welcome, even if they are just a simple palette change of the default flavor. Feel free to create a [pull request](https://github.com/HimasRafeek/ButterCake/compare) if you are a flavor creator.

- **New features** developed can also be submitted as a [pull request](https://github.com/HimasRafeek/butterCake/compare) and, after we receive some community feedback and there's some productive discussion, they might get added to the framework.

- For **third-party-libraries** and other features (such as new modules, components or Javascript libraries) developed for **Butter Cake**, please feel free to email me (contact@himasrafeek.com) and we'll take it from there.

- If you create **content that uses or showcases the framework** (Codepens, tutorials, videos or even a cool website or app), email me (contact@himasrafeek.com) a link to your content, so that I can help you share it with the world.

- For anything **not included in this list**, either open an [issue] (https://github.com/HimasRafeek/butterCake/issues/new) or send me an email (contact@himasrafeek.com).
